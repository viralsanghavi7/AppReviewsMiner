            <p>With increasing competition in mobile marketplace, developers are working on getting their
                application better and serve it's users. They can improve on their apps by using the wide
                source of information they get in terms of user reviews about their application.
                But main problem for developers is to filter out helpful & relevant reviews from the large pool
                of user reviews. With careful analysis of each review, we can output the most constructive and
                helpful reviews to aid developer in improving the quality of their product. This project will
                help them in working on the different characteristics of their application based on whatever
                feedback is given by user for their application.</p>
