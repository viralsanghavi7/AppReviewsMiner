They can improve on their apps by using the wide source of information they get in terms of user reviews about their application. But main problem for developers is to filter out helpful & relevant reviews from the large pool of user reviews. With information mining based on filtering algorithms we can output the most constructive reviews to aid developer in improving the quality of their product.
