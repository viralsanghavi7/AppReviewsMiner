Technical-AppReviews
====================

This proposal looks good.

Update: Some nice new work that should be a good inspiration:

### Some issues to consider:

* Your first priority is to get the review data, ASAP.  Let me know if you have have trouble.
* The proposal mentions, "areas of improvement".  You should make an explicit list.  How will these be defined?  Are these areas constant between apps (such as performance), or can they vary (be user defined).
* The type of algorithm you need to filter reviews will be largely defined by how you define "an area of improvement" and its level of abstraction.  There are several machine learning algorithms that might work here.
* Finally, what distinguishes your proposed work from the other previous work in KDD'13 and ICSE'14?
